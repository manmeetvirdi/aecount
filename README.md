Aecount
=======

Aecount is a simple, gesture-based counter for iPhone. It was created for my wife, who needed a counter app to help with her knitting, and she was unhappy with all other counter apps on the App Store. The goal was to have a (mostly) gesture-based app, with nice animations.

Usage instructions
==================

* Tap to increment.
* Swipe right to decrement.
* Pinch to reset.
* The upper label is the title of the counter.
* The lower label is the current goal.

Things to do
============

There are plenty of things one could do to improve Aecount. Here are a few ideas:

* Multiple counters
* More color schemes
* Saving to iCloud
* Better sounds

Misc
====

Aecount requires iOS 5.0. The project uses ARC, and requires Xcode 4.4 or newer. The [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/) branching model is used. 

Aecount uses [CocosDenshion](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-iphone) for playing audio, and the [Chunk](http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/chunk) typeface by Meredith Mandel. I've included these directly in the repository. If this is a problem, please contact me.
